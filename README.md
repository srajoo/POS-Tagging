# POS Tagging

The pos_tagger_notebook contains a simple tutorial on the flow of preprocessing a given dataset and applying the greedy and Viterbi decoding algorithms to predict the POS tags of each word in the given dataset.

On comparing the results of both algorithms, it is evident that Viterbi decoding outperforms the Greedy decoding algorithm.
